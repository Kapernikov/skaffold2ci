==============================================

   Release: |release|

A tool that creates CI configuration from skaffold.yaml

Documentation
-------------

This part of the documentation guides you through all of skaffold2ci usage patterns.

.. hint:: 
   This section (Documentation) can be used to organize any additional documentation. Read the `reStructuredText Primer <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_ to get a handle on the syntax.

   Markdown is supported as well via the `MyST <https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sphinx/intro.html>`_ sphinx plugin but does not support as much flexibility.

   The next section (API) contains the auto generated documentation from the docstrings in code. Add and organize the required directives to create a nice overview of all your code documentation.

   The last section on this page (Development) contains information on how to use and work with all the boilerplate in this project.
